4/13/25 Servo problem observations
1. From one day to another, with no changes, the servos stopped working
2. Not hearing clicking when movement requested
3. Everything functioning as expected except servo is not moving
4. Battery is still providing juice (able to light an LED with it)
5. PWM signal wire is still providing signal (able to light an LED with it)
6. Switched servo out for unused one, still doesn't work
7. Used different jumper cables, still doesn't work

Potential causes:
1. 6V 3000mAh battery is slowly running out of juice?
