PLAN A: Useless box:

Carve holes in side of box for: 
	1. Battery on/off switch on the back
	2. Useless box switch on the front
	3. USB cable to power MCU on the side

TODO FOR SHOEBOX PROTOTYPE:
Trim motor parts (bottom stuff and half of swivel)
ISR sets mvmt_request flag. Then, in while(1), 
	if(mvmt_request):
		delay(500 or 1000);
		if (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_8) == GPIO_PIN_SET)
			movement_handler_function_lmao();
		else mvmt_request = 0;

TODO FOR REAL BOX
Laser cut real box
3D print box lifter and arm to turn off switch
Get hinges for box lid
Sauter switch wires
Determine motor movements when switch flipped

What's going in the box:
Nucleo Board
2 MG995 Motors
6V 2000mAH NiMh battery
Breadboard
3D printed lid lifter attached to a motor
3D printed curved arm attached to a motor
Speaker
Whole bunch of wires

Peripherals:
2 servos
a switch
RGB LED
Speaker

Box Component Measurements:
Servo (x2): 1.85in length, 0.76in wide, 1.59 tall
Speaker: 2.72in length, 1.20in wide, 0.63in tall
Battery: 2.82in length, 2.00in wide, 0.57in tall
STM32: 3.46in length, 2.97in wide, 0.83in tall

Version 1 Box Dimensions
Width: 7in
Length: 6in
Height: 4in
USB hole diameter: 0.44in
Switch hole diameter: 0.24in
Distance from top to switch hole center: 0.648in (dist. to hole edge: 0.636+(0.24/2))

Version 1 Box Notes:
USB hole not big enough: Try 0.5in instead
Gotta do wire organizing
Can't see LED lights; maybe add a bunch of little holes on the walls?
Maybe mount lid servo to the wall?
